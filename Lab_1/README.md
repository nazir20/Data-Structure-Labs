## Lab 1

1- Write the program code that combines two sequentially given sequences.

```bash
  Input: dizi_1[] = { 1, 3, 4, 5}, dizi_2[] = {2, 4, 6, 8}
  Output: dizi_3[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 8}
```

2- Write the program code that removes duplicate numbers from a sorted array.

```bash
  Input: dizi_1[] = { 0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4}
  Output: dizi_2[] = { 0,1,2,3,4}
```

3- Write the program that shows the average of the entered numbers until -1 is entered from the keyboard.
